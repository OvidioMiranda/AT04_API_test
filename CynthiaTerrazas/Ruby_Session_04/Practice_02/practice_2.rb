=begin
Letsâ€™ assume you are a user for a user for an online shopping page (like amazon)
Create a class considering :
Initial  amount of items to buy are 0
Initial list of items with the specific price for each one
Initial list of items with the quantity of each one
Initial discount for each item as 0

Create a method to buy an item(ask for the item and for the amount,
after an item is buy, you should decrease the quantity from the list of items)

Create a method to calculated the price according the item/quatity selected

Outside the class call to the methods in order to perform the actions :
 define which items/quntity will be buy
Print the ist of items and the price calculated for each one
Print the balance of each item
Answer the question :
Should be better to use singleton for this implementation? Why?
