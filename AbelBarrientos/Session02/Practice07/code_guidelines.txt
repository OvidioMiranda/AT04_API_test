I think the team should adopt guide lines and best practices while writing in any
programming language.
After a little research I would recommend to adopt the best practices explained in:
https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
Also use a code analizer like RuboCop https://github.com/github/rubocop-github
That implements these best practices for writing ruby.
And make some changes if the project needs it.
