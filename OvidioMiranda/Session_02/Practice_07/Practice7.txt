Letâ€™s consider you are in a new team :
Define which code guideline you would suggest for :
Please Add your suggestion and define one example for each one.

*Format (int, float, string)
For the use of variables (int, float, string)
 Use snake_case for variables.
 I would advise using the ".to_" method to convert to the type of variable that will be used,
  so that there are no errors at the time of executing the script,
  For example:
  value_integer = number.to_i
  value_float = number.to_f
  value_string = word.to_s

*Classes
 _Use CamelCase for classes.
 For Example:

 class SomeClass
   # some code
 end

*Methods
 Use snake_case for methods.
 The methods should use with parenthesis.
 For example:

           def example_test(test1,test2)
           end

*Variables, Getter/Setter
For the variables we can use the following:
For example:

 _For the getter

  attr_reader :item_name

 _For the setter

  attr_writer :item_name

 _For the getter and setter

  attr_accessor: name

*If condition
For 'if then else' cases, it is best to replace it with a short-if expression.
expression ? value_if_true : value_if_false
