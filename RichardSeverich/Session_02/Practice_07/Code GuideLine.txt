Let’s consider you are in a new team : Define which code guideline you would suggest for :
Format (int, float, string), Classes, Methods, Variables, Getter/Setter, If condition
Please Add your suggestion and define one example for each one

===> 	Name identifiers in English:
bad 
nombre = Richard
good
puts name = Richard

===> 	Use snake case format all files, classes, methods and variables:
bad
someVar = 5
	def someMethod
	  	# some code
	end
good
	some_var = 5
	def some_method
  		# some code
end

===> 	Use Camel Case for classes and modules. (Keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML uppercase.)
# bad
class Someclass
  # some code
end

# good
class SomeClass
  # some code
end

===> 	Use snake_case for naming files
e.g. hello_world.rb

===> 	Use snake_case for naming directories
e.g. lib/hello_world/hello_world.rb

===> 	 Don't use the getters and setters 
use: 
	attr_reader
	attr_writer
	attr_accessor
===> 	Use "" if you need interpolation else use '' 
# bad
var = "Hello"
# good
var = 'Hello'

===> 	Avoid for loops and use the each method with a block
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].each { |elem| puts elem }

In addition to these points would request to follow the best practices mentioned in the following page:
